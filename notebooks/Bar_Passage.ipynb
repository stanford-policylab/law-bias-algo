    "\n",
    "The notebook uses the example of law school admissions and considers a scenario in which law schools attempt to maximize the bar passage rates of the students they admit. After all, U.S News and World Report law school rankings considers bar passage rate and could plausibly increase the weight given to the factor. If they did so, law schools would have a strong incentive to maximize their bar passage rates in order to improve their law school rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook proceeds by constructing a gradient boosted decision tree model and then applying the model to simulate the admission of law school applicants. It then considers whether there are differences in outcomes between the actual admissions results and the bar-passage optimized admissions results and whether any differences can be deemed algorithmic bias. It also considers some alternative ways to structure an algorithmic model for college admissions and compares the results of those approaches. "

    "### Testing an Alternative Admission Process: A Top 10% Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas adopted a top ten percent admission plan in 1997 for undergraduate admissions in the state. Anti-affirmative action advocates subsequently challenged the top-ten percent plan in the high profile affirmative action lawsuit *Fisher v. Texas* which was the subject of Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "A top ten percent admissions plan works by automatically admitting all students with a GPA in the top 10% of their graduating class and then admitting students for remaining spots based on holistic review. For our purposes we will simulate this by admitting all students with a GPA within the top 10% of all law school applicants and then using the bar passage rate model to admit students for the remaining spaces in the class. Notice, however, that this approximation fails to capture how a student's GPA ranks within their own high schools, which is central for how the top ten percent plan actually works. That is in Texas's actual policy, students are only compared to the other students within the same school. \n",

    "Simulate an admissions cycle for tier 5 and 6 law schools assuming a centralized top ten percent plan. First select all applicants with a UGPA in the top ten percent of applicants and then round out the class with students who have the highest predicted bar passage scores.\n"

Are their any concerns about state bar passage as an outcome measure? What factors might drive the differences between the different models?  How well does this model mimic the procedure of the actual admissions process? Are there important differences between the populations of interest that may influence the model in undesirable ways? How does the performance of actual admissions officers compare to the models we have here and to the extent there are differences in outcomes, what factors might drive those differences?"
