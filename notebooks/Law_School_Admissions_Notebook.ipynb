    "### Using Predicted Bar Passage as a Selection Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additioanl excercise we can consider what law school admissions would look like if law schools selected law students to optimize bar passage rates. This approach might be motivated from two perspectives. First, perhaps using an outcome-based algorithm would allow schools to lessen the weight on LSAT scores, given the critiques of standardized tests as favoring affluent non-minority groups, and hence constitute a \"workable race-neutral alternative.\" Second, more crudely, one of the major inputs into U.S News and World Report law school rankings is bar passage. Schools might want to admit a class to increase bar passages rates or US News might increase the weight of bar passage in its rankings. Our goal here is to examine whether the adoption of such a policy is a workable alternative and whether it might have disparate impact.\n",

    "We would now like to simulate admissions based on them admiting individual students who are predicted to pass the bar exam. Create a model to predict bar passage and then use this model to simulate an admissions cycle where the students predicted as being the most likely to pass the bar are admitted into the highest tier law schools. We will create our predictive model using logistic regression."

Consider whether minority students are more likely to practice in jurisdictions with lower bar passage rates (e.g., NY or CA)?
