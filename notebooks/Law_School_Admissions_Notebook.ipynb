    "This notebook proceeds by first exploring a data set on law school admissions. It then reverse engineers a possible model for law school admissions and asks you to consdier alternative models. Finnally, the notebook ends by considering whether predicted bar passage could serve as a better metric for law school admissions.

First, perhaps using an outcome-based algorithm would allow schools to lessen the weight on LSAT scores, given the critiques of standardized tests as favoring affluent non-minority groups, and hence constitute a \"workable race-neutral alternative.\" Second, more crudely, one of the major inputs into U.S News and World Report law school rankings is bar passage. Schools might want to admit a class to increase bar passages rates or US News might increase the weight of bar passage in its rankings. Our goal here is to examine whether the adoption of such a policy is a workable alternative and whether it might have disparate impact.\n",

    "One way to characterize the use of bar passage information is as an attempt to reduce the importance of the LSAT in determining law school admissions. Does using bar passage data fulfill the goal of reducing emphasis on the LSAT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider what some of the potential problems with this data set are. What factors are not represented in the data that might be relevant for predicting outcomes on the bar exam? For success as an attorney? Are their any concerns about state bar passage as an outcome measure? What factors might drive the differences between the different models?  \n",
    "\n",
    "How well do these models mimic the procedure of the actual admissions process? How does the performance of actual admissions officers compare to the models we have here and to the extent there are differences in outcomes, what factors might drive those differences? \n",
    "\n",
    "Are there important differences between the populations of interest that may influence the model in undesirable ways? Consider whether minority students are more likely to practice in jurisdictions with lower bar passage rates (e.g., NY or CA)? Consider whether stereotype threat or implicit bias might explain differences in academic or bar passage performance between white and minority students and what implications that has for the approach you've studied above."
